## Fullstack Amazon-Styled SOA Item Description Service 

Service-Oriented Architecture app modeled from the Amazon Item Description service. This service renders 
the description for different speaker items, and is built to:
  • seed and persist data (description summary, item name, item brand) for 100 unique product IDs,
  • Run alongside five other services via proxy server,
  • Display the description information and other information (price, reviews, ratings) fetched from other services,
  • Run locally, or be deployed via Amazon EC2.
  
Built with the MERN stack using MongoDB, and styled using React Styled-Components.
